            <h3>We have come across a canvas roll slitting and packing industry which had an issue in manual roll slitter machine. They couldn't able to adopt to fully automatic roll slitter in the market because of very high cost. So, buying a fully automatic machine is of no use. That's why we thought of automating only the part they require. Retrofitting is technology measures taken in the manufacturing industry to allow new or updated parts to be fitted to old or outdated assemblies. Semi-automating this could possibly solve most of the issues with the current machine. Motorizing the movement of the cutting bed is most effective solution for it. Stepper motor will the best choice to make precise moves. A controller will be installed to control each stepping of the cutting bed. Thus, more precise dimensioned product will be achieved. This will also reduce the material loss per roll, which thereby increases the production rate.</h3>
