            <h3>In the current scenario most of the countries do not have sufficient skilled man power than specifically affects the agricultural sector and the growth of developing countries. So it's a time to automate the sector to overcome this problem. An innovative idea of our project "An Autonomous Agricultural Seed Sowing Robot" is to automate the process of sowing crops such as sunflower. baby com. groundnut and vegetables like beans, lady's finger. pumpkin and pulses like black gram, green gram etc.. to reduce the human effort and increase the yield. The plantations of seeds are automatically done by using DC motor. The distance between the two seeds are controlled and varied by using Microcontroller. It is also possible to cultivate different kinds of seeds with different distance. When the Robot reaches the end of the field we can change the direction with the help of remote switches. The whole process is controlled by Microcontroller.</h3>
